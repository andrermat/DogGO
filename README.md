# DogGO

This project was made within the scope of the Interaction Person-Machine course, where we had the liberty to choose any theme. 
With this DogGO was born. The objective is really simple, do you need help with our dog? We are here for you. With our platform,
you can find service providers for multiple situations. Do you need someone to walk your dogs? Do you need someone to take your
dog to the veterinary? Do you need someone just to watch your dog while you are on work? We have it all. But not only that. In
case you also need to buy products for your dog, we have partnership with various known brands, just check our Pet Store!

PS: Since this was made for a course, and to have this working we had to alocate resources, the connection to the backend is not
working, so only some parts of the frontend are visible.
